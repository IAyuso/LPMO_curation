# LPMO_curation
This bash script(s) will get and filter the specific families required as they are annotated in the headers of dbCAN2 FASTA database file (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2/). An easy-to-edit example for AA10 LPMOs is given, so this can be applied to any CAZy family.
It is built around the wonderful faSomeRecords (https://github.com/santiagosnchez/faSomeRecords) and seqkit (https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) utilities for FASTA files, so they need to be installed and be accessible from any folder.
